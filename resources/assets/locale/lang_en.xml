	<string id="350">The Nuclear Physicist got his name from his father, who developed nuclear weapons for the government.  He was a young boy when the infection appeared, and he and his father valiantly defended their house against hordes of mutants.  The Nuclear Physicist can still remember the terror of watching a mutant worm that had smashed its way through their cellar walls swallow his father whole.  Searching through his fathers things, he found notes about how to upgrade any weapon.  But his most important find was a heavy metal box containing his father's best invention - a Plasma Cannon.  The Nuclear Physicist swore to avenge his father, so he seeks out infected areas looking for the worm and incinerating thousands of mutants with his cannon.</string>
	<string id="351">Nuclear Physicist</string>
	<string id="352">+ 25% Weapons damage</string>
	<string id="353">+ Weapon Plasma cannon (+15 bullets)</string>
	<string id="354">Superpower Plasma ball</string>
	<string id="355">Once a minute, the Nuclear Physicist can unleash a plasma ball. The ball hovers in front, freezing every enemy and inflicting damage of 1 life point. After 4 seconds, the ball blows up, inflicting damage of 1 life point on all enemies within the blast radius.</string>
	<string id="356">The only thing that remained in the wake of the infection was a number of small military detachments.  The soldiers of these stalwart units forged fortresses out of the ruined cities and defended themselves against the mutants.  While on a scouting mission, one of the detachments encountered a swarm of bugs.  When the sergeant saw the mutants killing his friends, he went mad and began spraying the battlefield with gunfire.  The hail of bullets killed not only the bugs, but also his friends.  When a rescue craft arrived, he refused to leave his bazooka behind.  Since that day, he's been called Destroyer.  People say he appears at infected zones from time to time to kill mutants with his bazooka.</string>
	<string id="357">Destroyer</string>
	<string id="358">+ 50% Blast radius</string>
	<string id="359">+ Weapon Bazooka (+15 bullets)</string>
	<string id="360">-10% running speed</string>
	<string id="361">Superpower Artillery strike</string>
	<string id="362">Once a minute, the Destroyer can use guided missile launchers. All enemies on the screen and the Destroyer get damage of 6 life points.</string>
	<string id="363">The gangs began to quickly spread in the ruined, disease-infested world. To protect their camps, the survivors hired people experienced in making trips to infected territory. The survivors called them "hirelings". The hirelings formed teams from experienced mountain men and volunteers with combat skills. Sometimes, small hireling teams ventured deep into infected territory to procure food, spare parts and medicines. The hirelings are used to operating in groups. Stragglers have almost no chance of surviving alone...</string>
	<string id="364">Hireling</string>
	<string id="365">+7% rating for killing mutants</string>
	<string id="366">+ Weapon Machine gun (+360 bullets)</string>
	<string id="367">Superpower Two weapons</string>
	<string id="368">Once a minute, the Hireling can use his battle skills, shooting from two of the same weapon at the same time for 4 seconds.</string>
	<string id="369">Survivors sometimes needed help military men or hirelings couldn't provide. Those in power could ask killers for help. A typical task for a killer would involve sneaking into a camp and neutralizing a victim. To fool a victim, she parades around like a street walker, and when she's attracted her victim, she ends his life.  After a kill, she seeks out shelter within the deepest infected areas.</string>
	<string id="370">Killer</string>
	<string id="371">+30% shooting speed</string>
	<string id="372">-20 life points</string>
	<string id="373">Superpower Victim's fear</string>
	<string id="374">Once a minute, the Killer can cause blood-chilling horror among his victims. All enemies on the screen are frozen and receive damage of 1 life point.</string>
	<string id="376">When the infection started, the Hunter refused to evacuate and instead stayed behind and protected his home. Through that experience, the Hunter learned how to survive in infected area by using food, bullets and his powers sparingly. The only things the Hunter trusts are his weapons.  Still, when the military asked him to protect the area around his house, he agreed he would as long as they provided him with food. In return, the officers promised to send a rescue helicopter to get him if things got out of hand.</string>
	<string id="377">Hunter</string>
	<string id="378">+25% time bonus duration</string>
	<string id="379">+ Weapon Double-barrel shotgun (+72 bullets)</string>
	<string id="380">Superpower Plasma traps</string>
	<string id="381">Once a minute, the Hunter can use 3 plasma traps that are triggered either after 5 seconds or when the enemy approaches. The blast freezes the enemies and inflicts damage of 1 life point.</string>
	<string id="382">The story of the Half-Mutant began with a betrayal.  When a rescue helicopter dropped in to take his team out of a battle zone, there wasn't enough room for him on the chopper, so his friends threw him out.  He used every last bullet in his arsenal to fight back the mutant hordes, but eventually had to run.  Before falling over from exhaustion, he removed his anti-radiation suit and tore off his gas mask.  "This is the end," he said.  Wounded and nearly depleted, he ran into an abandoned hangar, where he found a firegun.  Revived, he ran back outside and sprayed the mutants with fire, choking as the smoke from their burning flesh hit his throat.  "That's the smell of me surviving," he said, gritting his teeth.  When his weapon ran out of fuel, he tossed it aside and started tearing at the mutants with his teeth and nails.  He eventually overcame his enemies, and a nearby group of survivors saw him bite off the head of the last mutant.  They thought he was infected and had already trained their guns on him when he cried out, "Don't shoot!  I'm a survivor!"  Since that day, he's been trying to find out why he mutated and looking for the people who betrayed him.</string>

	<string id="389">People say the Fanatic went mad even before he acquired his abilities. Before the infection, he was studying the effects of plasma on human genes in an effort to create a superman.  He was so obsessed with his experiments, he used himself as a subject in one.  Unfortunately, there was an accident, and an explosion of unstable plasma destroyed his lab. No one knows how he survived or where he got his Superpower to control electricity. Some people heard him say he's looking for an energy source in the infected areas as well as artifacts created by mutations. Regardless, people give him a lot of space because they think he's a freak.</string>

	<string id="396">During the first few days of the infection, the military tried to stop it from spreading using means that were less than human, including dropping nuclear bombs on major population centers.  This killed a lot of mutants, but wiped out large numbers of perfectly healthy humans, too.  A nuclear explosion killed the beloved girlfriend of the Telepathist and doused him with radiation.  When he regained consciousness under the rubble of a demolished building, he discovered he was alone.  Enraged, he swore to kill everyone involved in the death of his girlfriend.  As time passed, he discovered the radiation had given him supernormal abilities, including pyrokinesis, psychokinesis and heightened senses. A thirst for revenge compels the Telepathist to turn his abilities against any and all survivors.</string>

	<string id="404">In every camp of survivors, there was one trusted person to whom every looked for guidance. Until her mutation, the Witch was one such leader.  One day, she decided to clean out a particular lair to end the frequent attacks by the bugs living there.  Several people disagreed with her plan and refused to risk their lives to carry it out.  Undeterred, and with a smaller than anticipated force behind her, she attacked the lair.  She was injured during the fight, but no one would come to her rescue.  Worse, those who came with her left her in the lair and told everyone at camp she'd died.  When the Witch opened her eyes, she could barely breathe and was covered with a slimy substance.  She thought she would die there, but the bugs left her alone, and she was able to escape.  Mystified, it took her a few moments to realize her DNA has been mixed with the DNA of a mutant.  She's left with an unbearable hunger and a desire to sink her teeth into the flesh of her betrayers and rip it from their bones.  She sneaks into camps, killing everyone she encounters.</string>

Its primary goal was protecting the government through special ops at the epicenter of the infection. As the infection spread across the world, the Cyborg was the only one in the detachment to survive. Tragically, he hopes to use his abilities to find and rescue others from his former detachment.</string>

	<string id="435">Research</string>
	<string id="436">The infection jumped quickly from city to city, taking over everyone with whom it came in contact.  As countless people succumbed to the horror, the survivors speculated about its origin.  Some said the infection was the result of a scientific experiment gone wrong.  Others said it was nature's response to the destructive behavior of human beings.  After the infection appeared, the survivors formed the first encampments and set about the task of determining the source of the infection in the hopes of bringing the plague to an end.</string>
	<string id="437">First Threat</string>
	<string id="438">The survivors in a southern camp decided to travel north to find the source of the infection.  They gathered together their best gunmen in an attempt to put together a team that would be able to survive in an infected zone.  Their path would take them through an abandoned farm that contained a number of wind turbines.</string>
	<string id="439">Mutation</string>
	<string id="440">Leaving the decimated farm still crawling with zombies, the heroes proceeded through the Wasteland, a desert region populated by mutants.  In time, the detachment came to an enormous junkyard.  A local resident reported seeing aggressive animal-like mutants with no skin among the mountainous piles of junk.  "Thick veins covered their muscles and pulsated with fury," the man told them.</string>
	<string id="441">Call</string>
	<string id="442">The battle lasted several hours.  Just as the group was starting to gain some ground, something huge rushed toward them through the piles of metal, tossing twisted cars here and there. Then they heard shrill howl.</string>
	<string id="443">Bugs</string>
	<string id="444">After the group had killed the Red Brainwinch, they saw an entrance to a strange lair.  They reasoned that the source of the infection might lie within it, so they went inside.  As they descended lower and lower into the pit, they noticed more and more mutant eggs on the walls.</string>
	<string id="445">Chitin</string>
	<string id="446">The insects attacked them again and again in an effort to kill them and protect their eggs. Among the hundreds of enemies they encountered, they saw one species with a super-strong protective shell.</string>
	<string id="447">Dangerous crack</string>
	<string id="448">As they made their way through the lair, the heroes found a deep crack in the wall. When they approached it, hundreds of red bugs - the most dangerous mutant insect - appeared.</string>
	<string id="449">Wrath</string>
	<string id="450">The heroes didn't find anything of interest in the lair, but did manage to pull themselves out of the jaws of the bugs.  Then they entered an abandoned factory.  Among the rusty barrels and fallen beams, something horrifying was about to make itself known...</string>
	<string id="451">Horns and teeth</string>
	<string id="452">While standing over the corpses of two creatures, the heroes decided to search the factory for clues to the source of the infection.  Why leave any stone unturned, they reasoned, including a major industrial complex?</string>
	<string id="453">Impenetrable armor</string>
	<string id="454">They found nothing of interest in the abandoned factory other than broken chemical equipment and dozens of double-legs, horned creatures filled with acid.  These bugs were especially tough to defeat because they spewed acid if they were enraged or about to die.</string>
	<string id="455">Painful blast</string>
	<string id="456">The expedition walked an entire day on a broken highway covered with abandoned cars to reach another city.  As night fell, they found themselves approaching the town.  Walking deep into its ruins, they spotted a huge pack of red double-legs.</string>
	<string id="457">Suffocation</string>
	<string id="458">The city was full of mutants. The group of heroes had to get to the other side of the city and find the survivors who had promised to show them a military laboratory, the place from which the infection might have come.</string>
	<string id="459">The carrier</string>
	<string id="460">Having survived the fight with the tentackled mutants, the heroes continued to make their way to the abandoned laboratory. The further they went into the infected city, the more insect-covered zombies they met. In a revolting example of mutant symbiosis, the zombies were tearing off the insects and throwing them at the survivors.</string>
	<string id="461">Laboratory</string>
	<string id="462">The survivors found the exit to the abandoned military laboratory and went down to the first underground level. They found upturned tables, barrels filled with chemicals and smashed blue incubators. Nobody knew what the scientists were growing there, as the volunteers hadn't found any documentation.</string>
	<string id="463">Dead flesh</string>
	<string id="464">Mutation - that's what the scientists in the laboratory were studying. They inadvertently created monsters while performing experiments on the genes of animals. This mutation was the beginning of the infection and the end of the human race.</string>
	<string id="465">Hole</string>
	<string id="466">In the laboratory, the survivors found a massive hole in the floor that led to the lair of the insects. Believing it to be the epicenter of the infection, the heroes descended into the stench-filled abyss.</string>
	<string id="467">Escape</string>
	<string id="468">The heroes killed the womb in the lair and then discovered they were trapped by the insects, which were growing in number!  Someone saw a pinpoint of light at the far end of a cave, and the heroes ran toward it as they fired their weapons over their shoulders.  On the surface, they found themselves at the foot of a mountain near a demolished city.  Although they were stunned, the sound of the advancing mutant horde prompted them to continue their escape.</string>
	<string id="469">Frozen lake</string>
	<string id="470">As soon as the survivors were safe, they decided to return to camp and tell everyone about the source of the infection.  In the burnt forest, they found a frozen lake. Fire had consumed everything around the lake, but the water was frozen because of the cold temperatures near the mountains.</string>
	<string id="471">Ice horror</string>
	<string id="472">The surface of the lake was solid enough to support the heroes.  Unfortunately, it also held up under the weight of the mutant hordes, who were hungry for human flesh.  The relentless beasts attacked again and again, giving the group no rest or hope of rescue.</string>
	<string id="473">Burnt forest</string>
	<string id="474">After a fight with the mutants called Screamers, the heroes found themselves in the forest again but on the other side of the lake. They saw a desert in the distance and decided to head in that direction, as the map suggested they would find another city.  Among the burnt trees, they saw what most of them thought were huge stones.  Some of the heroes thought they saw the stones shaking and believed they heard snarling.</string>
	<string id="475">Nuclear Desert</string>
	<string id="476">Scorched air burned the throats of the heroes as they approached the desert wasteland. This has once been a place of verdant fields and thriving villages, but the government had detonated nuclear bombs over the region in a desperate attempt to prevent the mutation from spreading.</string>
	<string id="477">Oblivion</string>
	<string id="478">The desert seemed endless. Many of the heroes died, while the others lost their will to survive.  In the distance, they saw the silhouette of a city destroyed by a nuclear bomb. The mutants seemed to be without number; no matter how many the survivors killed, even more appeared out of nowhere, stronger and more disgusting than the others.</string>
	<string id="479">Ruined city</string>
	<string id="480">Long shadows wrapped themselves around ravaged buildings like the claws of a monster.  As the heroes made their way through the rubble, they looked for food, weapons, ammunition, and survivors.  On every street, they saw fresh blood on the carcasses of ruined cars and piles of uprooted asphalt.  Something unthinkable was living in the city, but the only way out was to walk straight through.</string>
	<string id="481">Sunset</string>
	<string id="482">The heroes had barely escaped death in the city when they looked toward the horizon and saw countless mutants pouring across the wasteland.  Perhaps they had heard the gunfire, and were hungry for meat...</string>

As a result of frequent mutant attacks, he decided to mop up the bug hole. But not everyone agreed with this decision; not everyone wanted to risk their life.

Feeling a mutant's unbearable hunger and a desire to devour his betrayers, the Witcher is creeping towards the camp while destroying everyone in his way...</string>
